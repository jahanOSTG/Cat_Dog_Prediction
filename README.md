# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

A simple **Deep Learning project** using **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify images of Cats and Dogs.  
The model is trained on the [Cats vs Dogs dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/mledu-datasets/cats_and_dogs_filtered.zip) and deployed with a prediction function that takes any custom image and predicts whether it’s a **Cat** or a **Dog**.

## 🚀 Features
- Trains a CNN model on Cats vs Dogs dataset  
- Uses **ImageDataGenerator** for augmentation  
- Predicts from **any custom image** (from local/Google Drive)  
- Displays the image with result and confidence score
